Narrowly defined, an author is the originator of any written work and can also be described as a writer.<br /><br />2) An illustrator is an artist who specializes in enhancing writing or elucidating concepts by providing a visual representation that corresponds to the content of the associated text or idea. The illustration may be intended to clarify complicated concepts or objects that are difficult to describe textually, which is the reason illustrations are often found in children&#39;s books.<br /></p>"
